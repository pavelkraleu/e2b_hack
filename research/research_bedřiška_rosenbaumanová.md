## Detailed Research
# Bedřiška Rosenbaumová: A Brief Overview

## Biography

Bedřiška Rosenbaumová was born on August 5, 1868. She resided in Brno, Czechoslovakia, before her deportation during World War II. Bedřiška was transported from Brno to the Terezín Ghetto on March 23, 1942, as part of transport Ad, where she was assigned transport number 626. Tragically, she was murdered on August 4, 1942, in Terezín.

## Family Members

Bedřiška Rosenbaumová was married to Pavel Rosenbaum, a prominent figure in Úvaly, where he owned a stately property. They had at least two children:

- **Eva Rosenbaumová (later Eva Orlíková)**: Eva was married briefly in Český Brod. She was deported and murdered on June 12, 1942, in the Trawniki concentration camp.
- **Jiří Rosenbaum**: A gymnasium student, Jiří was deported and died at the age of 17 on September 6, 1942, in Majdanek concentration camp.

Pavel Rosenbaum, her husband, was a significant community figure in Úvaly, involved in local businesses and social activities, including the Sokol sports organization. He was arrested and died in the Dachau concentration camp on January 10, 1941. His remains were returned to Prague, where they were interred at the New Jewish Cemetery in Olšany.

## Relevant Information

The Rosenbaum family was deeply rooted in the community of Úvaly, contributing to local economic and social activities. They owned a large estate with a brick factory and were involved in various enterprises and community services, such as the local fire brigade and Sokol gymnastic society. Despite their contributions, the family was targeted during the Holocaust due to their Jewish heritage, leading to their tragic deportation and deaths.

A **stolperstein** (stumbling stone) was placed in Úvaly in memory of Bedřiška Rosenbaumová, serving as a poignant reminder of her life and untimely death. 

## Fate

Bedřiška Rosenbaumová was deported to the Terezín Ghetto where she was ultimately murdered. Her husband, Pavel, died in Dachau, and her children, Eva and Jiří, were murdered in concentration camps shortly after their deportation. The family's property in Úvaly was seized and repurposed, reflecting the broader persecution and dispossession faced by Jewish families during the Holocaust.
