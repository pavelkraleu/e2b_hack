## Brief Biography
Bedřiška Rosenbaumová was born on August 5, 1868, and was a resident of Brno, Czech Republic, before the German occupation during World War II. She was part of the Jewish community that faced severe persecution under the Nazi regime. Bedřiška was deported from Brno to the Theresienstadt Ghetto on March 23, 1942, as part of transport Ad. Tragically, she was murdered in Theresienstadt on August 4, 1942, just one day before her 74th birthday.

The family was well-integrated into the local community, although they faced increasing persecution after the implementation of the Nuremberg Laws in 1939.

The family property in Úvaly was aryanized during the Nazi occupation and later repurposed post-war. A memorial at the local cemetery commemorates the Rosenbaum family and other Jewish victims from Úvaly.
